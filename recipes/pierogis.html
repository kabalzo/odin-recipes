    <h2>Polish dumplings, best eaten hot and fresh!</h2>
    <p>Pierogis are filled dumplings made by wrapping unleavened dough around a savory or sweet filling and cooking in boiling water.<br>  
       Dumplings most likely originated in Asia and came to Europe via trade in the Middle Ages.<br> 
       Typical fillings include potato, cheese, quark, sauerkraut, ground meat, edible mushrooms, and/or fruits.<br>  
       Savory pierogi are often served with a topping of sour cream, fried onions, or both.<br>

            Add sauerkraut and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 more minutes.

        <p></p>
        <li>
            Make potato filling: Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat. 
            Cook and stir onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes.<br> 
            Stir in mashed potatoes, salt, and white pepper. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            Make dough: Beat together sour cream and eggs in a large bowl until smooth. 
            Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; stir into sour cream mixture until dough comes together.<br> 
            Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            Divide dough in half, then roll out one half to 1/8-inch thickness. 
            Cut into 3-inch rounds using a biscuit cutter. <br>
            Place a small spoonful of potato filling into the center of each round. 
            Moisten edges with water, fold over, and press with a fork to seal. <br>
            Roll and fill remaining dough half with sauerkraut filling.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Add pierogies in batches to boiling water and cook until they float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. <br>
            Remove with a slotted spoon.
