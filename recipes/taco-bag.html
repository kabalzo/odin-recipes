    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cook and stir ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain excess oil.<br> 
            Mix in water and taco seasoning. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            Gently crush corn chips in the sealed bags. Snip one top and one bottom corner off each bag, then cut open along the side edge.<br> 
            Spoon equal amounts of beef, lettuce, Cheddar, tomato, sour cream, and salsa into each bag on top of crushed chips. Serve in the bag and eat using a fork.
